# RNN-In-Numpy

This is an attempt at a bottom up implementation of the Recurrent Neural Network architecture with 3 layers and a `tanh` activation function using only `numpy` in Python. The LSTM code that is commented out is still a work in progress as there seems to be a logical error in the calculations. Suggestions are welcome.
